# Simulations with Uniform Distribution

## Simulation of Bernoulli trails
 - The number of heads are counted. The longest number of heads are plotted on a histogram
 - The experiement performed for different number of trials(20,50,100,200,1000). Histogram for each showing the number of heads in 50 flips.
 
## Simulation of Biased Coin where p(head) = 0.8. 
- The number of heads for 200 trials
- Histogram for Bernoulli trails with longest run of heads

## Fair coin toss until reaching a user-specified positive number of heads
